# RollsRoyceStore

For this project, I was inspired by the idea of a Rolls Royce website. This site allows you to order a car for yourself, collecting its design in parts. In my project, you choose the car and the color. We could have added some more features, but We were running out of time. Here are the interface and its class that are responsible for connecting to the database (IntDB, SqlDB). The "OrderControl", "OrderArchive", "DBW" classes are responsible for the application. Class "OrderArchive" implements interface "IntOrderArchive".
